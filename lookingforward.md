# Looking forward
I have mentioned this before, but an opportunity I really appreciate the class giving me was the external workshop on jewelry-making. I really liked that in the context of this class, it pushed me to analyze the work I did in the workshop in the context of digital humanities. Therefore, when I look into the future, I believe making jewelry and understanding the process more is a future skill I want to continue to hone. 
The three concrete steps I plan to take to learn this skill:
1) Read online to understand the history of jewelry-making and how it was implemented in renown brands.
2) Look at ways this process has been digitized — how does data benefit this process? 
3) Follow jewelry-influencers — people with a lot of knowledge on the history of jewelry, how renowned brands make jewelry, and the future of where the industry will go.

Especially as many classic jewelry brands are undergoing the transition into the digital world, I am curious how they are using data to adapt and further their brands. With that knowledge, I would be curious to see if I could create my own jewelry brand someday.
